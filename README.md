# ScriptsAndPrograms

This repository contains a collection of my scripts and programs
I've created to make the everyday use of my computer more convinient.

Most of the scripts are made with [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) and [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) in mind and are usually
triggered by a i3wm keybinding or i3bar update.

Working on cleaning these up, let me know if you have any questions.
